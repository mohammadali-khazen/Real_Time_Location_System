# Tracking Workers and Objects in Construction Sites through Bluetooth Low Energy Technology
Here are codes and datasets of a Real-time Localization System (RTLS) through Bluetooth Low Energy Technology.
The main goal of the developed system is to track workers and objects in construction site by considering various aspects affecting the RTLS applicability in the construction domain, including portability, affordability, scalability, and high positioning accuracy. In the proposed RTLS, the beacons replaced the commonly used receivers for the first time in localization that makes the system independent from wiring work and DC power supply, resulting in substantiality increasing the system's applicability on-site.

For this purpose, the beaconsâ€™ configurations are tuned, and a record correction algorithm is developed to solve the shortage of BLE packets limited payload that the receiver relies on to broadcast the location data to the gateway. Besides, a modular system infrastructure placement plan is proposed based on the effective devices' range to minimize the number of required devices on-site and improve the localization accuracy. The proposed localization estimation model leverages the placement strategy to categorize the records based on the estimated distances and the transmitter's position and finally localize them based on a developed technique for each category.
